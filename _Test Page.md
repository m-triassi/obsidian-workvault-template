Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries _Vokalia and Consonantia_, there live the **blind** texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, [a large language ocean](https://example.com). A small river named Duden flows by their place ~~and supplies it with the necessary regelialia~~. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of ==sentences fly into your mouth==.

```php
$var = "this is a string"
if (str_contains($var, "this")) {
	return "it has 'this'"
}
```
